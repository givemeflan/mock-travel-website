# mock-travel-website
This project is for an assignment I'm doing with TTS (Tech Talent South) Full Immersion Foundational Java Course. I will be creating a very basic mock travel site (I have Dubai as my inspiration) with some bootstrap components (navbar &amp; footer) and I will be using the grid system. My travel site does not look like a regular travel site visitors would go to so just keep that in mind. I was inspired by some WordPress templates I used to work with. This is a 1 page website.
